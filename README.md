# ML Sample Dataset

This is a sample repository for Various Machine Learning Models. The intent of this repository is to provide aid and insight into model training and testing. Each folder is named after the model used, with ipynb files readily available. Additionally, Google collab embedding is added to the ipynb in effort to make opening the repository in google collab, simplified.
